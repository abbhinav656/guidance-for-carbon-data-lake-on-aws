# This 3 stage ci pipeline is purpose-built for cdk in typescript
# it also includes support for python lambdas
# it implements a basic build, static check, and deploy process
# it also implements e2e and ckditten regional deployment tests
# these tests only run with merge to main
# this pipeline can be removed if and when this repo moves to github
